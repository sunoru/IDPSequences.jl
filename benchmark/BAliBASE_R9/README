The archive contains the reference alignments for reference set 9, subsets 1-4. 

RV911		Subset 1, <20% residue identity
RV912		Subset 1, 20-40% residue identity
RV913		Subset 1, 40-80% residue identity
RV921		Subset 2, sequences with true positive motifs only
RV922		Subset 2, sequences with true positive motifs and sequences with errors
RV931		Subset 2, sequences with true positive motifs only
RV932		Subset 2, sequences with true positive motifs and sequences with false positive motifs
RV941		Subset 2, sequences with true positive motifs only
RV942		Subset 2, sequences with true positive motifs and true negative sequences 

Each alignment has 3 files associated with it:

*.in_tfa	the unaligned sequences in FASTA format
*.msf		the reference alignment in GCG MSF format
*.xml		the reference alignment in XML format, with motif annotations

A C program is also available in a separate archive for comparing an alignment with the reference alignment, and for calculating the score for the motif alignment quality.
